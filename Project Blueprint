User Stories:

[see additional instructions on Quercus]

[aim for at least one user story per group member + 1 extra; in the table below, each group member must be assigned to one user story + mark one user story as being a team user story — this one should be the one that is most central to the basic functionality of your system. That is, the one you would probably want to implement first.]
