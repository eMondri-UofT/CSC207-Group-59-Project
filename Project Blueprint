Team Name: The San Toronto 59rs

Domain:
This will be a choose your own adventure game implementing monsters from a DND5e API: www.dnd5eapi.co

Software Specification:
The program should display to the user a choose your own adventure game using Java Swing, allowing for various user inputs and randomly selecting monsters using the DND5e API appropriate to the user's level and possibly how much they have played.
[think in terms of nouns and verbs, which will map onto variables and methods in the program]

User Stories:
[statements of interactions between the user and the system]
User inupts __command__ and the system __responds__
[see additional instructions on Quercus]
[aim for at least one user story per group member + 1 extra; in the table below, each group member must be assigned to one user story + mark one user story as being a team user story — this one should be the one that is most central to the basic functionality of your system. That is, the one you would probably want to implement first.]
