**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either: \
Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle   or \
Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.** 


Principle 1: Equitable Use
* We might add text-to-speech functionality to read the game screen to users.
  * This would work because the game is largely text-based
* We could make font size and buttons larger for those that have difficulty seeing \
\
Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
* This program is usable in their preferred format for both those who prefer mouse and those who prefer keyboard.
* The program should not need to provide preferences for factors such as color, since the program is entirely black and white with obvious black borders on the only blue element, the buttons. \
\
Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
* Progress in the game is largely built around clicking buttons, making progressing in the game easy and Intuitive.
* Each button’s function is clearly labeled and it is relatively simple to understand what they will do based on the labels. \
\
Principle 4: Perceptible Information
* Buttons are very clearly differentiated from background / labels, by both color and border
* Text area for NPC dialogue is made clearly perceptible through border lines. \
\
Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
* Functionality like an “undo” button does not make sense, as the user should be punished for progressing without taking full advantage of their options.
* Unfortunately, this can cause frustration with misclicking the “next” button, but the functionality of the game takes priority. \
\
Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
* Buttons are inherently low physical effort, and can be clicked either with the mouse or using keyboard functions like “tab” to move between buttons and “spacebar” to click
* As a text based point and click game, the program causes minimal fatigue in players. \
\
Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
* The program is playable with one hand using a mouse, or potentially with one finger moving across the keyboard.


**Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

This program, were it to be monetized, would be targeted towards fans of text-based adventure games. It might also aim to introduce computer games to players of Tabletop Role Playing Games like dungeons and dragons. It could even be marketed to connoisseurs of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel enjoyers. 


**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**

This program will likely not be used by individuals who find difficulty reading or counting (dyslexia, dyscalculia), or those who have limited eyesight/visibilittheys they would find it difficult to get full use out of the game. It’s possible that some forms of colorblindness could affect the experience of users as well.
